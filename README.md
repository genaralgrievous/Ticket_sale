# Online Ticket Sales System

## Overview
The **Online Ticket Sales System** is a Python-based application designed to simulate the process of buying and canceling tickets for concerts. It utilizes a simple architecture divided into three modules: `Agents`, `Events`, and `Example`. This modular approach ensures code readability, reusability, and ease of maintenance.

### Key Features
- User registration with unique IDs, names, and emails.
- Concert management, including adding new events with ticket availability.
- Ticket purchase and cancellation functionality.
- Event-based communication system to handle purchase and cancellation requests.
- Simple command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
